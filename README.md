Project Title: Software testing for a Real-world Software Application


_________________________________________________________________________________


Project Overview : 

The main objective of this project is to assess the software quality of a real-world software 
application by designing and implementing a comprehensive testing strategy. Students will 
choose an open-source or freely available software application, Web or Mobile, with a 
comprehensive services. The selected application should have sufficient features and complexity 
to allow for meaningful testing.

Project Specifications:

A) Selection of Application Under Test
Students should choose a suitable software application, Web or Mobile, and provide a brief 
justification for their choice.
Ensure the application has multiple features and functionalities to test.

B) Requirements Analysis:
Analyze the documentation, user manuals, or any available resources to understand the 
functional and non-functional requirements of the selected software.

C) Create Comprehensive Test Plan: Document testable requirements and create a test plan.

D) Create Test Cases: Develop detailed test cases covering various scenarios, including positive 
and negative test cases. Each student in the group should create four test cases for core system 
functionalities using well known black or white box testing techniques.

Additionally, create a traceability matrix linking test cases to requirements. Test cases should be 
written using specialized testing tool/framework such as Jira.

E) Execute test cases and analyze the results, and document the bugs revealed.

F) Test Automation:
Identify suitable test cases for automation. Using selenium ide . Each student 
should implement two automated test on the GUI for certain scenario.

G) Performance and load Testing:
Design and conduct performance and load testing for relevant scenarios. Justify your tool 
selection.
Analyze and report on the application's performance under different conditions.

H) Presentation and Report:
Prepare a comprehensive presentation summarizing the testing process, challenges faced, and 
key findings.
Write a detailed report covering all aspects of the testing process, including test plan, execution, 
automation, performance testing, and results analysis.
